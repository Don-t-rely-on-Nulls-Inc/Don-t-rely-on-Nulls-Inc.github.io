Our team members shared a rare trait in the current landscape of software development: we have
indescribable levels of **fun** when producing software that fulfills its purpose. This reached a
certain point in which we all grouped up to create the study group <a href="https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">Dr.Nekoma</a>.

<br>
This group is dedicated to explore distinct programming languages to tackle a myriad of problems in different
domains. From games, to databases, to programming languages, we do it all in the pursuit of leveraging different
mental models of programming by playing with uncommon programming languages, such as various Lisp dialects, as Common Lisp and Racket; static FP-based
languages, as OCaml, Haskell and F#; and perhaps even old-fashioned OOP languages, as Objective-C. There are more than 150 videos 
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMyzdYsPiBU3xoqaOeahr6Q" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">Youtube</a> to serve as documentation of this ongoing journey. You can check some of these projects <a href="/projects" style="text-decoration:underline">here</a>.

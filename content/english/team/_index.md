Our team members shared a rare trait in the current landscape of software development: we have
indescribable levels of **fun** when producing software that fulfills its purpose. This reached a
certain point in which we all grouped up to create the study group <a href="https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">Dr.Nekoma</a>.
<br>
This group is dedicated to explore distinct programming languages to tackle a myriad of problems in different
domains. From games, to databases, to programming languages, we do it all in the pursuit of leveraging different
mental models of programming by playing with uncommon programming languages, such as various Lisps dialects, such as Common-Lisp and Racket; static FP-based
languages, such as OCaml, Haskell and F#; and old-fashion OOP languages, such as Objective-C. There are more than 150 videos 
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMyzdYsPiBU3xoqaOeahr6Q" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">Youtube</a> to serve as documentation of this on-going journey.
